# Database-for-an-event
In this application the customer reserves a ticket for a cultural event, which he can buy online or from a distribution shop or ticket offices. The price of the ticket varies based on the person (age, unemployed, etc.) and from time to time there are discounts. Also, the customer has the possibility to contact the management of the event for information, or in case of cancellation, the possibility of changing the date for a future screening is given. The show takes place in a certain period of time with a certain number of views. The event will take place in a designated location (eg theater, stadium) with a limited number of seats.

## Database Diagram
I used db designer tool:

## SQL (Create Database)
Connect python with a database and with a SQL query the user can access all the available tickets -and the corresponding seat- with the click of a button.

## UI 
I made a User Interface where the user can see the available tickets, events and do the reservation by adding his/her personal info:
